1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:01,792
My name is David.

2
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,328
And I'm here to tell you about the

3
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:05,376
the biggest screw up of my life.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,168
17 years ago.

5
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:11,776
My wife Caroline and I adopted a baby from an Asian American family.

6
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:15,616
I didn't get to know them personally, because as far as I understood,

7
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:18,944
they were really insisting on as much privacy as possible.

8
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:23,552
Therefore, we knew very few details and never insisted to know more.

9
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:27,136
The only thing I learned about them was that they were too young for children.

10
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,184
Talking about ourselves, we're talking about ourselves.

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,256
we were absolutely ready to adopt the child.

12
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:35,840
We had already been in a waiting list for a very long time.

13
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:38,656
And honestly, we were so eager to become parents.

14
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:41,472
that we didn't care much about the baby's origins.

15
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,544
How silly I was not to find out more.

16
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:50,176
Anyway, we adopted this beautiful, smart, and affectionate baby.

17
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,712
We called him Justin

18
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:55,040
It was truly love at first sight for all of us.

19
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,088
He was growing up quickly and

20
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,136
And when he was about 8 months old...

21
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:04,512
we started to feel a little bit guilty about raising him disconnected from his ethnic background.

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,096
We live in an area with a major Chinese population

23
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:11,424
So, we felt it would be easy to introduce Justin to his roots.

24
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:17,312
So, for the next 17 years, we were doing everything we could to honor our son's ethnicity.

25
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:21,152
We sent him to Chinese language courses and by five he was

26
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:24,736
already fluent in Mandarin and English. I told you.

27
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,272
He is really smart.

28
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,600
We also found a Chinese couple who made friends with him and

29
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,648
and took care of his cultural upbringing.

30
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,488
They invited Justin to their place to celebrate Chinese holidays.

31
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,304
I took him out for dim sum every couple of weeks

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,096
and helped him practice his Mandarin.

33
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:43,936
We've been taking him to China every two years since he was eight.

34
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:49,568
We weren't trying to force him to take up his culture because we didn't want him to feel different.

35
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,336
from us.

36
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,384
But we didn't want to rob him of it either.

37
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,688
We were sure to be doing the right thing.

38
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:01,088
It was all going so well until a week ago, I was filling out Justin's college financial aid application.

39
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,928
I needed to find some old documents I hadn't used in a while.

40
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,280
I took the whole bunch from the folder and was browsing them when suddenly

41
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:13,120
My glance fell on my son's old adoption records and there...

42
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:13,888
surnames.

43
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,448
of his biological parents pop out.

44
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,264
I felt literally petrified.

45
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,568
His parents' last names were Park and

46
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,848
and Kim.

47
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,384
Cheeeeeese!

48
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,968
Those are Korean last names.

49
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,272
My son is not Chinese.

50
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,064
Not even a little bit.

51
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,112
He's Korean!

52
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,952
I don't assume every Asian is Chinese and I'm-

53
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,256
I've always mocked people for doing this.

54
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,072
But I did assume this from my son.

55
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,888
Now, I have a 17 year old Korean son

56
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,192
that thinks he's Chinese.

57
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,496
I've dedicated nearly two days to this.

58
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,520
decades.

59
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,568
to guiding Justin towards the roots?

60
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,872
that aren't even his.

61
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,944
The worst part of all the story.

62
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,992
is that I have yet to disclose this to you.

63
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,528
this to my son and wife.

64
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,320
I honestly don't...

65
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,600
I don't even know if I will.

66
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:16,096
